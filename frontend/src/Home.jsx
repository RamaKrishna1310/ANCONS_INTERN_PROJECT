                <p className="text-[25px] text-gray-500">With the increasing recent trends and developments in genetics, genomics, and artificial intelligence, it's getting less difficult and more rapid to identify and treat diseases. A trend that is gaining significant attention presently is that AI is fundamentally altering precision medicine by analyzing large amounts of genomic data to customize treatments and therapies for individual patients. It is also being used to predict three-dimensional protein structure, which is crucial for understanding their function and developing new drugs.  Parallel to this advancement is genome sequencing, where next-generation sequencing technologies enable researchers to sequence entire genomes more rapidly and efficiently. Likewise is the trend with the use of RNA-based therapies, such as mRNA vaccines and RNA interference, and the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology that is currently being used to develop novel treatments for genetic diseases. Genomics is another approach being used to study endangered species and predict protein structure for better understanding and drug development. </p>
